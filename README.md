## Labs

Practices done during the Web Development Bootcamp at IronHack.

#### Module 1: Responsive design with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

In Module 1 we learned the fundations of HTML and CSS basics, responsive web design using Flexbox and Bootstrap, and JS basics, together with the core concepts of object-oriented programming, DOM manipulation, and version control.

#### Module 2: The back-end

In Module 2 we learned how to create a server and discovered the intricacies of data modeling. We learned NodeJS, ExpressJS, Handlebars, MongoDB and Mongoose.

#### Module 3: The Front-end

In Module 3 we learned about the Client-Side using ReactJS, how to create Single Page Applications (SPA) and component-based frameworks.



## Projects

After each module we created a final project to apply all the knowledge learned so far.

#### Module 1: Breakfas.t

After two weeks we created our first project. I created a breakfast recipes searcher where the user can find any recipe searching by ingredient. It's a web page developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript using Sponnacular API connection. You can check it on https://github.com/cristinacastro/Breakfast

#### Module 2: At Once

In week 6 begins the Module 2 project, which we do in pairs, and that we named **At Once**. We combine all the technologies learned and create a full-stack web application using Express.js as a foundation and Mongoose for models and database communication. The web have some validations on its models, includes sign up, log in and log out functionalities with encrypted passwords and authorization and supports two types of users. Also have routes for Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) features for the different models. You can check the deploy on Heroku [here](https://projecte2ih.herokuapp.com/)

#### Module 3: Splitapp

In week 9 begins the Module 3 project, which we do in pairs, and that we named **SplitApp**. The project is a single-page Web application designed for mobile devices using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js). We use React for all of the user-facing parts of our application, Express.js for our API back-end that our React app communicates with and Mongoose for models and database communication. The app includes sign up, log in and log out functionalities with encrypted passwords and authorization. You can check the deploy on Heroku [here](https://project3ih.herokuapp.com/login).
